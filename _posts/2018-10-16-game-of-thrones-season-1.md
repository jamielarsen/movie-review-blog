Game of Thrones relies heavily on its source material and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I know that this review is a little late. Especially since it is being released approximately 7 years after the first season of Game of Thrones. However, GoT(as it is known by its fans) has aged well. While the special effects and the cinematography is nothing to boast about (it isn’t horrible, but it isn’t amazing either), the plotline and the well-acted characters more than makes up for it tenfold.

Game of Thrones is the name of a series written by George R. R. Martin. The main character of this series is the Iron Throne or more accurately, the quest for it. Whoever sits on the Iron Throne is the king and whoever is king will probably die sooner or later. 

No matter how simple you think the plot may sound, it isn’t. Game of Thrones isn’t just about physical warfare, it is also about mental warfare(No, not telepathy). Most of the characters are devious and cunning. The ones who aren’t, are dead or will die.

All the characters are believable and I think that is one of the main reasons for this show’s mainstream success. For example, Ned Stark is an honourable man and always keeps his honour. Sean Bean understands this and acts this character out as if the honour that he carries with him is a burden. Another great example is Tyrion Lannister, who is played by Peter Dinklage. Tyrion is stunted height-wise(referred to as a dwarf) but is very bright. Peter Dinklage plays this role to absolute perfection because he understands that Tyrion views his stunted height not as a disability, but as an ability mainly because people will overlook him. There are many other characters that I know I have not mentioned here, but if I did try to get to them all, this review would take me a year to write.

Game of Thrones’s epic fantasy is captivating and it always leaves you wanting to know what happens next as well as the consequences of what has happened this episode. The special effects are amazing for a show that was made 7 years ago they have not aged well. While Season 1 was very interesting, this season seemed to be just set up for the next few seasons and I don't mind that. 

**Cinematography:** 1.7/3

**Acting:** 2.5/3

**Plot:** 2.7/3

**Total:** 6.9/9.0 or 81.1%
