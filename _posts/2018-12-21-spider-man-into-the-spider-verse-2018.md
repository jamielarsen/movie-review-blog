Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse captures the essence of its comic-book origins. It also tells an amazing story that is rooted around the main character. The way the writers develop the characters over the course of the movie is beautiful especially in the later stages of the movie. It is particularly enjoyable to see multiple different Spider-Men/Women/Robots in one universe.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales, a young teen who gets bitten by a radioactive spider that can turn invisible in a lab owned by Wilson Fisk. As soon as he gets bitten by the spider, a large battle ensues between Spider-Man(Peter Parker version), Fisk and the Green Goblin. Peter Parker is trying to prevent Fisk from opening a portal to another dimension. During this fight, Spider-Man comes into contact with the portal, which leads to other Spider-Men/Women/Robots being pulled into his dimension. Miles’s character starts out being relatively insecure and over the course of Into the Spider-Verse he starts to become more and more confident. The writers also introduce the characters in the other Spider-Men/Women/Robots in a humorous manner. By doing so, they have managed to keep the movie light and enjoyable to all people. 

The cast of this movie really brings their A-Game adding depth and reality to the characters rarely seen in animated features. Hailee Steinfeld’s vocal performance of Spider-Gwen is great because even though Gwen’s character is very isolated, Steinfeld still voices the character in a manner that gives us a chance to relate to her. Nicholas Cage also plays Noir Spider-Man in a deadpan humorous manner that adds a slight tone of hilarity to the movie.

The visual aesthetic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is gorgeous. Every frame in this movie looks as if it has been ripped straight out of the comic book. This movie is similar to what I imagine Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World would have looked like had it been animated. I particularly enjoyed how alive New York City and how nice some of the 3D shots(shots which require the camera to move in the Z-Axis) looked. I also loved the little easter eggs that were popped into the movie.

Into the Spider-Verse is hands down the best animated movie I have ever watched. In fact, I am disappointed that some people may have decided not to watch it due to the fact that it is an animated movie. If you haven’t watched it yet, DO IT NOW!
