The Disaster Artist is worth a watch just for James Franco’s amazing impersonation of Tommy Wiseau. He has nailed Tommy Wiseau’s accent and by doing that, he has also managed to bring to life a character that is shrouded in mystery. However, even if you did not watch the movie for James Franco’s(Spring Breakers, This is The End, Pineapple Express) performance, there are so many other reasons to watch this movie. Not only does Dave Franco gives a great performance as Greg Sestero, but the story also plays like a sweet, touching buddy comedy.

The movie’s main arc seems very similar to that of a buddy comedy. James Franco is most famous for Pineapple Express so I can see why he would try to replicate that into this movie. It follows Sestero, a nervous actor, and Wiseau, who puts it all out there, as they try to rise through the ranks in Hollywood. When everything that they try fails, instead of giving up Tommy Wiseau decides to make his own movie. This movie is based on a true story, but leaves out some parts of Wiseau’s life to make the movie more interesting(coupled with the fact that nobody knows anything about him).

The movie’s script has been adapted from The Disaster Artist by Greg Sestero, a book which chronicles the story of how Sestero met Wiseau and how the greatest worst movie in the world was made. The movie does have its fair share of moments where you are torn between supporting Sestero or Wiseau and it does give a well-thought-out representation of Wiseau’s ego. I particularly enjoyed the way that the film showed how much ego Wiseau had and how much control he wanted over his movie. 

James Franco does justice to The Room. It is obvious that he has put a lot of effort into playing Tommy Wiseau. I was stunned while watching the comparison shots that are shown just before the credits. Aside from a few obvious differences(different actors, slightly different delivery), the scenes were acted out to the most minuscule detail.

**Cinematography:** 1.8/3

**Acting:** 2.5/3

**Plot:** 1.9/3

**Total:** 6.2/9.0 or 68.8%
