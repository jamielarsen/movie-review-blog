Django Unchained is a brutal but an insightful lens into an era where slavery runs rampant. Robert Richardson returns as Director of Photography while Christoph Waltz returns as the second lead. I particularly enjoyed how Tarantino’s stylistic violent aesthetic really shone through thanks to the Western setting. Samuel L Jackson also returns in a relatively minor role that he embodies really well. 

Django Unchained is a prequel to the original Django that was made in 1966. It follows a slave who becomes a bounty hunter and then sets out to save his wife from a life of slavery. The story unfolds in a fast-paced manner and no part of it feels unnecessary or unneeded 

Tarantino’s famous dialogue returns in this movie after suffering a momentary lapse in Inglorious Basterds. One scene that comes to mind is the scene when the KKK members are discussing the merits of having larger “eyeholes” in their masks. I also enjoyed the way the story and the characters were represented. There may be some minor historical inaccuracies, but I think that the quality of the story matters more than the accuracy of the story, especially since the Wild West is just being used as the setting of the movie. In Inglorious Basterds, none of the characters in the movie were badasses(they were just insane), but in Django Unchained, the titular character is a stoic badass.

This isn’t Jamie Foxx’s best performance but Christoph Waltz delivers another great performance as Dr King Schultz. He plays a conflicted bounty hunter whose final act is an act of good. I also enjoyed Samuel L Jackson’s performance as Stephen. Only a great actor can make you hate the character that they play so much that you actually feel happy when they die.

The cinematography in Django Unchained is nothing different. Although all the scenes are shot and framed well, it just doesn’t have the same impact as it did in Inglorious Basterds due to a different style of editing being used.

Django Unchained is a great movie and is definitely a step up from Inglorious Basterds.
