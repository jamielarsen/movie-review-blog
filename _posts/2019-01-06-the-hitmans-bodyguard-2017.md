The Hitman’s Bodyguard is like every other mediocre action movie. The plot is generic and bland even though the premise sounded interesting. However, this movie does have one thing going for it. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson is perfect. These two veteran actors, play off each other well, but still, maintain that quality in their individual scenes. The shots in this movie are lit too brightly and it gives the movie an unprofessional feel.

The Hitman’s Bodyguard follows a bodyguard who, after accidentally letting one of his clients die, has been reduced to a husk of his former self. He is then called by his ex-girlfriend to guard the life of his nemesis, who is renowned for being a top class hitman. His nemesis’s life is in danger because he is a primary witness in a court case against a Belarusian dictator who has committed multiple acts of genocide. So this pair must stick together for 27 hours before the trial. The plot is all over the place and feels massively overexpanded. What could have easily been a one and a half hour movie ended up being a two-hour romp through the streets of Amsterdam.

Ryan Reynolds plays Michael Bryce, the bodyguard, well but it is only when Samuel L. Jackson comes into view does the movie begin to get interesting. This is partly due to the contrasting dynamic between the two characters but most of the credit has to go to the chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson. Reynolds has an intuitive sense of comedic timing and the movie is improved due to that.

The camerawork in is mediocre due to the fact that every scene has been lit too brightly which gives the green-screened scenes a highly unprofessional look. The editing is also quite basic but there are a few interesting smash cuts thrown in here and there. The fight scenes also become boring after a while due to a large number of fight scenes. The car chase scene felt like it could have been trimmed down a little as it is not crucial to the plot in a large way.

**Cinematography:** 1.7/3

**Acting:** 2.2/3

**Plot:** 1.5/3

**Total:** 5.4/9.0 or 60%
