Every once in a while, I watch a movie that is impossible for me to review. Goodfellas is one such movie that is in the same category as other movies such as The Godfather and Pulp Fiction. However, I have decided to try my hand at writing this review. Goodfellas is an amazing movie that is backed by stellar cinematography as well as a slew of great actors. This movie is also based on a true story.

Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill and his life in the mob. After conducting a big heist, the FBI starts to come down hard on the mob and Hill fears for his life. The movie also utilises narration effectively. The characters are realistic and this makes the characters relatable even though they are criminals. A great example of this is Karen Hill(Henry Hill’s wife) when bad things happen to her, the audience feels for her emotionally. Although the plot may sound pretty basic and cliched, Goodfellas is told in an enrapturing manner which is further bolstered by great performances from Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro. 

Robert De Niro is such a great actor. In one scene, De Niro’s character does not say a single word, but he still manages to convey his character’s emotions to the audience solely by using his facial expressions. Ray Liotta, who plays the lead role of Henry Hill also plays his character well by making the character relatable even in his worst moments. Pesci plays Tommy in such a volatile manner that the character is immensely hateable. However, thanks to the way the narrative is set up we still feel bad for him when his character is hurt.

The cinematography in Goodfellas is stellar. Martin Scorsese utilises freeze-frames, long takes and tracking shots so effectively to communicate the story. The tracking shots add an element of familiarity to the movie, especially since the character of Henry Hill is used to introduce us to the other characters and since he is a part of the family, the tracking shots make the camera seem as if it is an additional character. The freeze-frames also adds a pause for the narrator(Henry Hill/Ray Liotta) to explain the situation to the audience.

Goodfellas is an instant classic and an insanely hard movie to review. This is mainly due to its ability to hook the reviewer and make him/her forget about the review. At least I tried!

**Cinematography:** 2.5/3

**Acting:** 2.4/3

**Plot:** 2.3/3
