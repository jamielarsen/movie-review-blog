The only way you know that a drama is gonna be a good one is if it starts off with a bit of death. Castle Rock starts out with a suicide that is played out to perfection. For those of you that don’t know what Castle Rock is, the simplest way to explain it is that it is an amalgamation of Stephen King’s books. The acting is always on point and the cinematography is pretty good. 

Castle Rock’s plot is complex and is very intricately detailed, as it weaves together many of Stephen King’s universes. As I do not want to spoil the plot I will not go into any details. The show follows Henry Deaver (played by Andre Holland) after he receives a phone call from Shawshank State Prison about an inmate (played by Bill Skarsgård). Once the inmate is released, horrible things start happening to the town. 

Sissy Spacek (Carrie) gives an amazing performance as Ruth, an elderly woman dealing with Alzheimer’s. In fact, episode 7, which focuses entirely on Ruth, is one of the most gripping performances I have watched on television in a long time. Bill Skarsgård (IT, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2) gives an unsettling performance of “The Kid”. 

One of my major gripes about the show is how the season finale panned out. The season finale sees everything return to the status quo with some characters taking over other character’s roles. A lot of the subplots have an ending that feels rushed and essentially very cliché. 

Do not get me wrong. This is an amazing series however, I feel like the ending could have been done a lot better. I do realise that this is an anthology series and I have some ideas about what the post-credits scene could possibly be hinting at for next season. 

**Cinematography:** 1.8/3

**Acting:** 2.2/3

**Plot:** 1.4/3

**Total:** 5.4/9.0 or 60%
