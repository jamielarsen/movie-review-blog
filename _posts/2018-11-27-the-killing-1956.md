The Killing is a heist movie that is recounted to the audience in a non-linear manner. While most aspects of the movie are executed well, the narrator seems to be disinterested and this leads to the audience feeling disengaged from the events that are occurring on-screen. However, the plot of the film itself is strong enough that it doesn�t really rely on the acting too much. Despite this, the acting is great and Sterling Hayden is particularly good at delivering his lines in a manner that fits the role he is playing. The music in The Killing is a positive addition to all of the scenes. Stanley Kubrick uses diegetic sound to advance the plot effectively.

The Killing follows Johnny Clay, a veteran criminal planning one last heist at a race-track. He assembles a crew of criminals to perform the robbery. However, George Peatty accidentally reveals this information to his wife. Little does he know that his wife is cheating on him with a member of the mob. She reveals this information to her lover. Although I won't spoil this movie's story for you, I will say that the editing expertly conveys the non-linearity of the story. The characters all feel well-developed and they feel real because they have flaws and problems that they need to deal with. The ending of the movie doesn�t really fit into a movie that seems so deeply rooted in reality.

The movie is narrated by Art Gilmore, however, this narration feels impassionate and doesn't add anything of value to the plot thanks to the movie�s great editing. Despite this, Sterling Hayden portrays his character well, mainly using his eyes to depict Johnny�s emotions. Marie Windsor also plays Peatty�s wife well presenting the character in a conflicted but greedy way. 

The cinematography is smooth and does a great job of showing the audience the timing of the events that are happening in the story. The editor shows certain scenes over and over again to point out the chronology of the events that occurred/are occurring

The Killing is a great heist movie that has a strong plot, strong cinematography and relatively strong acting. The music works well with the movie and Kubrick utilises diegetic sound to advance the plot well.
