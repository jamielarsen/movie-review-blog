Big Mouth is a little immature at times, but what really shines through is the stories that are told in each episode. Everything that happens seems like something that a teen going through would be able to relate to. There are many meta references to real life that are absolutely hilarious. 

One of Big Mouth’s real strengths is that anybody who is past the age of 13 can relate to the show. Everything that happens in this show has probably happened, to one or more of the actors at some point. The series is also able to take something as empty as a bunch of guys staring at a girl’s breasts and evolve it into a meaningful character arc.

The character arcs in this show are interesting and there are a couple of new characters introduced in this season. However, they are introduced quite late into the show and are not being used to their full potential. This show does take you through a roller coaster of emotions especially if you can connect with the kids. This is something that the writers have made it exceptionally easy to do.

Big Mouth doesn’t do half-arsed character arcs. Coach Steve is easily one of the best adult characters with Maurice(Does he really count as an adult?) coming a close second. Coach Steve is one of the most innocent characters on the show and it is great to see that almost an entire episode is devoted to an important milestone in Coach Steve’s life(I won’t spoil it). Another great character is Jay. His character arc is heartfelt and well executed even though his character is crazy. 

There is nothing amazing about Big Mouth but it is worth watching when you don’t want to deal with the world’s bullshit. Not only is it easily binge-able(6 or so hours), it is also funny enough that it will make you snigger and has plenty of laugh out loud moments.
