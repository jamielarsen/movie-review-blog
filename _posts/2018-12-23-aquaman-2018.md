At best, Aquaman is a generic superhero film that does little to set itself apart from other superhero movies. Consequently, it also inherits both the good and the bad from other movies. It has a predictable plot that is some surprisingly funny humorous moments as well as action-packed fight scenes. 

Aquaman follows half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry as he goes on a journey to recover the Atlantean throne from his half-brother King Orm. One of my major qualms with the DC Cinematic Universe is that none of their movies feels as if they are set in one universe. For example, Aquaman only has one reference to the Extended DC Universe. Moreover, it chooses to reference Steppenwolf, one of the worst villains to ever exist in any movie. Many parts of the movie feel like they have been ripped directly from other movies and slammed right into this one. Aquaman doesn�t spend a lot of time developing its characters either. 

Jason Momoa is honestly one of the best parts of this movie. He presents the character to the audience in a way that we do not expect to see, especially when watching a DC movie. Momoa delivers his lines in a dry tone that is humorous. Amber Heard�s portrayal of Mera is also interesting as you can see that her character is very conflicted between betraying her family and doing what is right.

The fight scenes in Aquaman are expertly choreographed and coordinated by Jon Valera who is known for his work on Creed II, Deadpool and John Wick. The camerawork during said fight scenes is exceptional with the entirety of the opening fight scene being done in one shot. This adds a slightly videogame-y tone to the movie. The visual effects used were exceptional, especially in the underwater scenes. I particularly enjoyed how some of the larger set-piece action scenes really captured the enormity and insanity of the scene itself.

Aquaman may be generic but it is a ridiculously fun movie that is perfect for switching off and not thinking at all!
