The Hateful Eight is a highly engrossing and brutally engaging tale that unfolds in an imaginative manner. Every single member of the cast gave a delightfully intriguing manner, with Samuel L Jackson’s performance as Major Marquis Warren being especially entertaining. The entirety of the Hateful Eight was recorded using only 70mm film. This lent every shot in the movie an added sense of clarity.

The Hateful Eight is set in Wyoming in the 1870s. A stagecoach with 4 passengers(two bounty hunters, one sheriff and one criminal) stops at a haberdashery because of a large blizzard that is on their tail. They find other people already in the haberdashery. This movie is a combination of a murder mystery, thriller and a western as well as being Tarantino’s third foray into a quasi-historical movie setting. 

I particularly enjoyed the way the film mostly took place in one location and instead of mainly focusing on the action(although there is a lot of that as well), the story also focused on learning about the characters themselves. This is effective as, not only will the audience be more invested in the story, but also because the audience can put together their own versions of what they believe to be the truth. Tarantino’s signature format of non-linear storytelling returns, but sadly the dialogue that he is so well known for in his earlier movies seems to have taken a bit of a dive. 

Tarantino made a decision that he would use 70mm film when recording the Hateful Eight. This is a decision that has come to impact the final product in a positive way. By choosing to use a wider and crisper format, Tarantino and his collaborator Robert Richardson(who has worked with him on his past four movies) would have had to think about the placement of actors and props in the scene. This was done magnificently. Every shot was framed perfectly and every camera movement was smooth and lucid. 

The Hateful Eight’s cast is made up of renowned actors and all of them live up to the full extent of their talents. Although I enjoyed watching Samuel L Jackson play Major Marquis Warren, I believe that his dialogue was too stereotypical and doesn’t capture the essence of Tarantino’s style of writing dialogue. Walton Goggins, who played Sheriff Charles Mannix in the film, also gave an excellent performance.

The Hateful Eight is a film that sometimes feels a bit slow and meandering(especially in the first hour). However, if the viewer actually gives it a chance, it will eventually hypnotize the viewer in it’s amazingly well-acted, shot and executed plot. If this was any other movie other than a Tarantino movie, it would be considered a great movie. Sadly, it has come with the Tarantino brand attached and while it lives up to most of my expectations, it did not manage to be the greatest Tarantino movie.
