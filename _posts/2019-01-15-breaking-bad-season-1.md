Breaking Bad is a very interesting TV series that does feel a little dated at times. From amateurish camera work to unlikable characters, everything about this TV show feels like it was ripped off from every other TV series that was made in 2010. So what makes Breaking Bad so interesting? Well, Breaking Bad’s most interesting point is it's plot as well as it's demonstration of scientific concepts. Not only does Breaking Bad explain everything it needs to explain in a nice and neat package, but it is also home to Bryan Cranston’s amazingly solid performance of Walter White.

Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who has just turned 50. A few days after his birthday, he finds out that he has Stage 3A lung cancer. Sadly, it cannot be cured, but only treated. Desperate to find money to leave for his pregnant wife and teenage son, Walter begins cooking methamphetamine with one of his ex-high school students. Breaking Bad incorporates science into its story seamlessly and never feels to exposition-y. However, some of the characters are just way too unlikable even though they should be likable. This feeling of unlikability is also due to the poor performances of the actors that play their respective characters.

Bryan Cranston’s performance of Walter White is that of a man that is slowly beginning to accept his current state in life. Sadly, however, we have to wait until the last couple of episodes to see Walter become a true badass. This is a change that is worth waiting for, as when the transformation appears, Cranston’s performance, as well as the overall quality of the episode, improves tenfold. 

Breaking Bad has an overreliance on shaky camera shots. This often leads to a disengaging feeling, as the actions of the characters are not clearly shown to the audience. However, the editing of the lab scenes, are exceptionally well executed. Music is also used effectively, as is silence. I also particularly enjoyed how the scenes have a different tone after Episode 6(in which something pretty big happens to Walter’s head)

**Cinematography:** 1.9/3

**Acting:** 2/3

**Plot:** 2.2/3

**Total:** 6.1/9.0 or 66.6%
