The Man From U.N.C.L.E is defined by its visual style and cinematography, Sadly, it’s plot is too cliched to match up to other modern spy movies. However, by utilising its classic vintage feel to its full potential, it manages to be an engaging affair all throughout. None of the actors give particularly good performances, however, none of their performances are horrible either. I enjoyed the rapport between Solo and Illya, played by Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer respectively as well as the chemistry between Gaby and Illya. 

The Man From U.N.C.L.E follows two spies, one from Russia and one from America, as they are forced to partner up to save the world. The duo only have a single lead. The daughter of a missing German scientist. 

The dialogue in this film feels slightly stilted and the delivery of said dialogue even more so. In it’s short running time, the movie manages to incorporate all the classic tropes in every single spy movie ever. All of Solo’s lines seemed very arrogant and there are never any scenes where he demonstrates a capability for emotion. Although this might be intentional, I feel that Solo would have felt more three dimensional had some more texture been added to the character.

The cinematography is this movie’s defining feature. All of the shots(and editing of aforementioned shots) are beautifully executed and convey the feeling of a classic spy movie(mainly 007). I really enjoyed the transitions in the infiltration scenes of the movie. 

Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have a great on-screen rapport. Cavill’s character was too stoic and Cavill had hardly any expression on his face while he was being tortured. Hammer’s character, on the other hand, seemed to only feel anger, arousal and betrayal. Not once in the movie, did I see a single other emotion acted out by Hammer. 

I enjoyed the Man From U.N.C.L.E and I was engaged during its entire one hour and fifty-six-minute. I think that if this movie had been released in the 80s, it would have gone on to be a cult hit. Sadly, it was not and it eventually falls into the trap of trying to be both like a classic spy thriller and a modern spy thriller. All in all, The Man From U.N.C.LE was a thoroughly entertaining movie and I wouldn’t mind watching a sequel.
