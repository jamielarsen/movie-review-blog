Meet the Parents relies mainly on the chemistry between Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller to get laughs from the audience. Add this to a heap of uncomfortable, lengthy silences and the result is Meet the Parents. Even though the combination of Stiller and De Niro works well on screen, the plot is too predictable and cliched to even pass for interesting. In fact, most of the comedic scenes rely on the expressions that De Niro conveys using body language.

Meet the Parents follows Greg Focker as he goes to visit his girlfriend�s parents. Greg hopes to propose during the weekend, only to have everything go nightmarishly wrong. Little does he know that his girlfriend�s father is very paranoid and even manages to almost completely wreck Greg�s relationship with his girlfriend Pam Byrnes. This plotline is as cliche as it sounds and while the movie feels heartfelt and genuine, Meet The Parents is way too predictable, even though it gets its laughs from the most unpredictable circumstances.

Ben Stiller is a great fit for the role of Greg. He looks awkward and shy, almost constantly. The delivery of his lines ties into the awkwardness through which he portrays Greg�s character. There are a lot of uncomfortable silences and pauses. Stiller and De Niro have a great on-screen chemistry as in-laws and a lot of the dialogue receives an additional dimension of depth thanks to their respective performances.

The cinematography in Meet the Parents is relatively mediocre. Some of the cuts do not look right, as well as, some shots been framed in ways that do not seem natural to the eye. However, some of the edits are particularly good and add to the comedic value and hilarity of certain scenes. Sometimes the editor decides to linger on some shots and this adds to the awkwardness of certain scenes.

Meet the Parents was a good movie, it just felt too predictable and cliched even during it's wildest moments. However, De Niro and Stiller play off each other so well, it is easy to forget about it.
