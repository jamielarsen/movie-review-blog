Bad Times At The El Royale has such an interesting premise but it fails miserably in the execution of the premise. While boasting an impressive cast with the likes of Jon Hamm, Dakota Fanning and even Chris Hemsworth, the movie fails to keep the feeling of suspense and tension going throughout the entire film. However, the cinematography is well executed and the way colour is used to represent different things through the entire movie is intelligent.

Bad Times At The El Royale is very similar to the Hateful Eight, but with two distinctly different features. While the Hateful Eight is set in Wyoming, Bad Times At The El Royale is set on the border of Nevada and California, and the El Royale hotel is divided into two distinct sides. For example, if you are on the Nevada side, you cannot purchase any drinks. Another different aspect of the movie is the time period. The Hateful Eight is set in the Wild West Era when bounty hunters were still a thing, while Bad Times At The El Royale is set in the 60s, while the Vietnam war was still a thing. One of the major disappointments for me in the movie was the unsatisfactory “happy” ending. If the movie had ended on the same depressing note as the Hateful Eight, I would have been much, much happier especially since that sort of ending fits into the context of the movie. The villain is also only introduced about ninety minutes into the movie and the writer-director, Drew Goddard of Cabin in the Woods fame, fails especially in the pacing of the film.

Jeff Bridges plays Father Flynn in a highly intriguing way. His depiction of Alzheimer's/Dementia(isn’t very clear which one it is although it is one of the two) is interesting and engaging. Chris Hemsworth also plays Billy Lee, the villain, in a sociopathic manner that fits the character really, really well. 

The cinematography in Bad TImes At The El Royale is well-above average. The camera moves so smoothly that you’ll forget you are even watching the camera move. The framing of the shots is also perfect and conveys the time period that this movie is aiming to capture well. I also particularly enjoyed the distinctions in colour and lighting in both different states.

**Cinematography:** 2.3/3
