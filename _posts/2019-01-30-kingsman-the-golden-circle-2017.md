Kingsman: The Golden Circle is almost as good as Kingsman: The Secret Service. Almost. But something is missing. This iteration of Kingsman seems to be the exact same movie as The Secret Service, except with a different villain and a different method of world domination. However, this works, but only if the viewer decides to just sit back and watch the movie. Apply the slightest bit of logic and everything goes to shit. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman have also spun some bullshit just to reintegrate Colin Firth back into the series and this is jarringly obvious(even a blind person would notice it). Taron Egerton and Colin Firth are also unable to replicate the same dynamic chemistry that was crucial to The Secret Service.

The Golden Circle is hilarious, but still fails to use its absurd moments to elicit laughs from the audience and instead resorts to using shock tactics to keep their viewers engaged. Certain unexpected deaths are integrated into the plot smoothly, but will have no sense of impact to anyone who has watched Kingsman: The Secret Service, due to Agent Galahad's resurrection. The Golden Circle also feels as if a lot of crap that should have been left on the cutting room floor has been reinserted to overexpand the movie's runtime. The ending of the movie is highly unsatisfactory, mainly due to the fact that it sees everything return to the status quo.

Taron Egerton and Colin Firth do not come close to reaching the same dynamic relationship that was at the heart of Kingsman: The Secret Service. The reason for this is because Firth's character played the role of a mentor in the first movie, while Egerton's character was a student who eventually came into his own over the course of the movie. These roles have been reversed in this movie.

The quality of Kingsman's action scenes has not declined. The action scenes leave an impact because rather than being a heavily edited mess,they are done in long takes(although I am sure they utilised computer generated keyframes at some point, the fight scenes are just too long and complex to be done in one shot). There is also an overabundance of CGI used in this movie, a fact that is quite obvious visually due to the way that the CGI heavy scenes are shot.
