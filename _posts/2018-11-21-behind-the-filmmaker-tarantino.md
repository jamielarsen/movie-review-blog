Quentin Tarantino is a well-known director and writer, renowned for directing(and writing) films such as Pulp Fiction and Django: Unchained. He has also written scripts for other directors, such as True Romance, Natural Born Killers, and From Dusk till Dawn. He has stated that he plans to retire either at 60 or after he releases his 10th movie. 

Tarantino’s movies are distinguished by large amounts of over-the-top stylistic violence, cynical dialogue, as well as references to movies and popular culture. He never went to film school and instead learnt from watching movies. It is estimated that Tarantino has watched over 3000 movies in his lifetime. Somehow, he has managed to retain this knowledge and utilise it in all of his films.

Dialogue is an important part of the Tarantino experience. Although most of his films contain a lot of action, dialogue is still a major part of his movies. Tarantino’s dialogue differs from other dialogue, mainly because most of the dialogue does nothing to advance the plot. Instead, this dialogue offers us a window into the characters themselves, thereby creating an emotional connection to the characters. A great example of this is the famous “Cheeseburger” scene in Pulp Fiction. The characters are not discussing anything vital to the plot, however, the delivery of said lines is entertaining and manages to convey to the audience that these characters are not just cold-blooded killers.

This aforementioned style of dialogue also utilises a technique known as “the bomb theory”, a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock. At its most basic, the bomb theory is the act of giving the audience information that the main character does not have. When used well, this element can create an almost overwhelming sense of suspense and tension. Tarantino’s most effective use of this theory was in Inglorious Basterds. The opening scene of Inglorious Basterds has a slow build-up of tension. Almost as soon as this tension finally dissipates, Tarantino builds it up again, by bringing the same two characters back together. 

The camerawork in Quentin Tarantino’s movies is always nothing short of amazing. The cinematography often is set up to work hand-in-hand with the dialogue. It conveys a sense of tension and suspense through smooth camera movements and close-up shots. A great example of this is the famous one-take shot in Kill Bill. The camera moves all over the place but it is always smooth and never makes the audience feel nauseous or sick.

Tarantino is known for resuscitating the careers of actors who may be finding it slightly hard to get a job. He always picks the correct actor for the role and has a knack for being able to inspire great performances out of them. Tarantino also has a informal “repertory company” of actors. Samuel L. Jackson is one of Tarantino’s frequent collaborators, appearing in 6/8 of Tarantino’s movies. 

Quentin Tarantino’s movies have evolved over the years. From Reservoir Dogs to the Hateful Eight, his movies have only gotten better(bar Pulp Fiction, that one was his best). Tarantino’s next project is Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and utilises the backdrop of 50s Hollywood and the Manson Murders as its setting.
