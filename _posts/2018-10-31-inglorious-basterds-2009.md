The opening scene of Inglorious Basterds made me sweat. When the way that the dialogue was written met with Christoph Waltz’s portrayal of Hans Lanza the tension in the scene became almost palpable. Every shot in the movie is framed impeccably by Robert Richardson, with whom Tarantino had collaborated with before, on Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2. Inglorious Basterds sees some great performances from all the actors. However, while the movie does contain some Tarantinoisms, it doesn’t contain as many as expected. 

Inglorious Basterds follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers who commit violent acts against the Nazis who have occupied France during World War 2 and a cinema owner who is forced to play a German propaganda movie. From there the movie gets increasingly more interesting as Tarantino weaves together multiple different storylines and makes them converge on one particular place, date and time.

Christoph Waltz’s performance is menacing. Every scene that featured him trying to intimidate a character often managed to intimidate me, due to the veiled threatening look that hides behind his calm, cool manner. I also enjoyed watching Brad Pitt play Aldo Raine is his crazy macho American accent.

Every shot is framed with thought and with purpose. Richardson who is well known for his work on Hugo and Casino has put a lot of effort into conveying a sense of atmosphere into each and every shot. This movie skips out on a lot of the Tarantino styles, but still manages to add some of the shots that he is known for using in his movies(360 shot, God’s Eye shots). There were one or two cuts that were noticeable but not horribly obvious.

Inglorious Basterds is set during the German occupation of France in World War 2. However, it is set in an alternate universe where the Basterds are a super violent force that collects enemy scalps. The choice to make this movie using a stylish, violent aesthetic and combining it with brash humour was a good one.

Inglorious Basterds was a good movie by normal movie standards, but it wasn’t a great one when compared to Tarantino’s other filmography. This is mainly because it doesn’t include many of the things that makes a Tarantino movie a Tarantino movie. I did enjoy the unpredictableness of the plot and the sheer insanity behind some of the Basterds' characters.
