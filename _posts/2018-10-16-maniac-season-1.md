Maniac is beautiful. You can pause at any moment in this series, take a screenshot, set it as a wallpaper and be greeted by beautiful eye candy every time you turn on your device. While Jonah Hill(Superbad, 21 Jump Street) and Emma Stone(Easy A, La La Land) both deliver amazing performances and the artistic direction is superb. However, Maniac does not execute the premise that is promised well.

Maniac is impossibly hard to sum up, but here goes. Maniac follows Annie(Emma Stone) and Owen(Jonah Hill), two strangers that join a pharmaceutical trial. Annie has no goal in life after losing her sister, while Owen is a schizophrenic. The pharmaceutical trial promises that after participating in the trial, all their problems will be cured. 

Emma Stone and Jonah Hill both provide some great moments where you can really reflect on their core characters. Both of the main actors play 5 characters each. This show really blends the lines between reality and illusion. However, my favourite character is Dr James K. Mantleray(played by Justin Theroux). While he is mainly there for comic relief, Mantleray serves as an important window into the people behind the pharmaceutical trial.

The series has a really wack(off-kilter) aesthetic which looks super cool and Cary Joji Fukunaga(True Detective, Jane Eyre) has stepped out of his comfort zone to provide this aesthetic. While the first two episodes are hard to get through, but once you do get through them the series gets much better. However, Maniac is limited by its frail plot.

Fukunaga has directed what seems like 10 mini-movies in this ambitious project that he has undertaken. The series does get confusing but in the end, it feels worth it, thanks to outstanding performances from Stone and Hill. This series also has a very Inception-esque feel to it and I enjoy that. I hope that there isnâ€™t a second season as this season ended in a very neat way and there is no reason for a second season
