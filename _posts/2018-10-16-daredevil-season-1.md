Daredevil has been my favourite comic book character for over 3 years now(ever since I read the Guardian Devil story arc) and this Netflix series only cements my love for Daredevil even more. I started watching this series a couple of years ago, but stopped when I got to a particularly gory scene(Hey, I was only 12). When I watched it back then, I couldn’t appreciate the intricate details that this production has paid attention to. 

For those of you that don’t know who Daredevil is, he is basically a bad-ass blind dude who goes around beating thugs up at night and is a lawyer by day. However, the writers have given Daredevil the Christopher Nolan treatment. This basically involves adding an element of realism and darkness to the show. It only works because Daredevil was born and raised closer to the streets than most heroes. As most of you probably know, the world we live in today is filled with things happening underneath the surface. Drugs, embezzlement and murder all run rampant in our streets today and the writers have taken that and transposed it into this fictional version of New York City. 

The cinematography is brilliant. In episode 2 there is a fight scene that is taken in one shot. This fight scene felt and looked brutal and realistic. Martin Ahlgren(Altered Carbon, House of Cards) who is the main cinematographer has stated that the fight scene took 8-9 takes and was filmed in 7-8 hours. There are a number of scenes where the amazing camerawork really shines.

The chemistry between actors Charlie Cox(The Theory of Everything, Stardust) and Elden Henson(The Hunger Games, The Butterfly Effect) is so realistic, especially in the flashback scenes of college. They feel like real best friends. In the show, Daredevil is very conflicted. He is torn due to his Christian faith, his love of the law and his love of Hell’s Kitchen. Charlie Cox seems to understand this and plays the part well. 

Heroes are only as good as their villains and I think that the writers have created a lifelike villain that you could possibly root for. I might have been rooting for the Kingpin to win during the early stages of the series. Vincent D'Onofrio understands that the Kingpin is only a human and is not an emotionless being.

One gripe(goddamn I love that word) I have with this show is Daredevil’s suit because it makes him look like a toddler trying to play hero. This is just a minor problem and takes away a little bit from the immersion of this world that the viewer is trying to experience.

All in all, Daredevil is a well-written crime-noir superhero series, that contains 13 episodes of amazing television. FIX THE SUIT.
