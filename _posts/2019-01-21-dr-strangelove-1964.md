Dr Strangelove Or How I Learnt To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb(I'm just gonna call it Dr Strangelove) is one of the finest pieces of political satire that I have ever watched. I have many reasons for saying this and I shall justify each and every one of them easily. First up on my justification list(I guess that's what I'm calling it) is its plot. Dr Strangelove combines satire and seriousness without even breaking a sweat. Another thing that impresses me about Dr Strangelove is the quality of the acting, with Peter Sellers taking on the majority of the lead roles in the movie. He plays 3 characters that are each vital to the plot in their own way, and he manages to endow each of the characters with their own little quirks through his wonderful acting.

The movie is sharp and funny, even if we do not expect it to be so due to the seriousness of the subject that it is attempting to broach(nuclear war is no joke). The movie doesn't try to be funny through jokes or other means. Instead, Dr Strangelove takes a bunch of serious old men and chucks them in a room, so that we get to watch them scramble all over the place trying to fix an issue that cannot be fixed by them. The result is that their reactions to the issue at hand are much funnier than stupid one-liners being shoved into our face. Although it's ending feels unsatisfactory, it does end on a note that fits in with the rest of the movie.

When watching Dr Strangelove, you might not notice that there are three characters being played by the same person(Although, now that I've told you, you probably will). That person is Peter Sellers. The best part about Sellers's triple-performance is the fact that I have just mentioned above this one. All of his characters are so distinguishable from each other, and although this is partly due to the way the plot is written, Sellers's performance helps to bring this believability to another level.

The quality of the cinematography in Dr Strangelove is varied, but the majority of the shots are very well set out, with smart choices being made to foreshadow certain plot points. However, I did not particularly enjoy, how all the shots on the aircraft over-relied on using a shaky camera. Some of the cuts aren't given much thought, while others are.

Dr Strangelove does deserve multiple viewings, and I will update this review as I see fit.

**Cinematography:** 2.2/3

**Acting:** 2.3/3

**Plot:** 2.4/3

**Total:** 6.9/9.0 or 76.6%
