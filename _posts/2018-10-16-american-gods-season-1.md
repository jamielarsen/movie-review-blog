American Gods follows former convict Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) after he is hired by the enigmatic Mr Wednesday (Ian McShane). He finds himself drawn into a world where some seriously weird shit goes down.  Specifically, a world where the Old Gods (Odin, Czernoborg, Ēostre) are preparing for a war with the New Gods (Mr World, Technical Boy, Media). The story tied together many arcs very neatly and is philosophical.

Ian McShane (John Wick: Chapter 2, Pirates of the Carribean: On Stranger Tides) really did justice to Mr Wednesday. In the show, Mr Wednesday is portrayed as a bitter old fraud with a valid reason to be bitter. It is also nice to see that Laura Moon got a bigger role in the show than in the book where she is just a very minor character.

According to Zackery Ramos-Taylor, the slow-motion shots from S1E1 were mostly done with blood bags and only some of it was CGI-ed. The cinematography was brilliant and I especially loved the scene with the Technical Boy (“Don’t. Fuck. With. Me”).

Instead of putting the facts in front of you and tying them up neatly, American Gods gives you the same amount of information as Shadow. This leads you to sometimes feeling confused and unhinged from the world.

The season finale of American Gods leaves much unfinished and I absolutely cannot wait for season 2.
