Ralph Breaks The Internet suffers from a condition known to many as unnecessary sequelitis. When I saw that Wreck-It-Ralph was getting a sequel, my first reaction was WHY? However, Ralph Breaks The Internet is a completely different beast when compared to its predecessor, and is often more like the Emoji Movie than the first Wreck-It-Ralph movie. It isn’t as bad as the Emoji Movie(thank god) and actually tells a half decent story even if the movie feels insanely over-inflated.

Ralph Breaks the Internet follows it’s titular character Ralph and his friend Vanellope. Both Ralph and Vanellope are video game characters who live inside arcade machines. One day, Vanellope's arcade machine is broken and the owner isn’t able to pay for the replacement part. Ralph decides to embark on a mission to go to the internet, find the part and send it to the owner of the arcade. The movie executes it’s emotional moments well but still spends a lot of time waffling on stuff that doesn’t really add meaning to the story.

Sarah Silverman voices Vanellope Von Schweetz well, capturing the essence of the character in a manner that adds depth and makes the emotional moments more… well emotional. John C Reilly also voices Ralph well making us feel for him and connect to the character due to his insecurities.

The animation in Wreck-It Ralph is amazingly executed. Most of the movie takes place on the internet and the method through which the internet is represented to the audience is interesting and engaging. The lighting and composition of the shots were beautiful and the way the plot is conveyed through simple character actions is simple yet so effective. However, none of the product placements are subtly placed. Instead, they are thrown in your face as aggressively as some of the pop-ups that are made fun of in this movie.

Ralph Breaks The Internet tells a story that is directed at kids but there is plenty here for adults to appreciate as well!
