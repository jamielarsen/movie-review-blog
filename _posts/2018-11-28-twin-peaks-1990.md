Twin Peaks is considered by many to be one of, if not the greatest TV shows ever made. I was expecting to be disappointed by the show as I had set such high expectations for it. Instead of being disappointed, I found myself hooked and continued to watch it. Twin Peaks eclipsed every single one of my expectations. Not only is the cinematography brilliant, but it also fits in well with the off-putting plot. The actors are amazing all throughout the series and I never found myself bored or distracted while watching this enrapturing piece of television. 

Twin Peaks follows Special Agent Dale Cooper after he is called to the peaceful town of Twin Peaks following the murder of Laura Palmer. Along the way, he discovers that something much more sinister is occurring and that this murder is connected to other supernatural events that occur during the course of the season. Twin Peaks is a show that is built around its characters and instead of choosing to use the characters as objects to advance the plot, David Lynch and Mark Frost choose to use the plot to advance the characters. This is such a character driven show that each and every single one of the characters gets the chance to be in the spotlight, even the relatively minor ones.

The cinematography in Twin Peaks is chilling and fits in with the music well. The camera work does an especially good job of conveying a sense of fear, delight and confusion to the audience. In Twin Peaks, the camera is treated like an actor(especially in the later episodes). I particularly enjoyed the surreality of the footage even though the object that is in the frame is normal. This leads to the audience tensing and this tension is never lost, even through cuts and fades.

The actors really bring their characters to life by portraying them with a wide range of emotions and gestures. Kyle MacLachlan embodies Special Agent Dale Cooper as a badass FBI cop who notices the smallest details and loves his coffee while Sheryl Lee, who plays the deceased Laura Palmer also portrays her character in a manner that intrigues and capture the attention of the audience.

Twin Peaks is the literal peak of television and with Season 1 ending on a cliffhanger and wrapping up some subplots, I cannot wait to dive into Season 2!

**Cinematography:** 2.5/3

**Acting:** 2.5/3

**Plot:** 2.6/3
