Fear and Desire is renowned director Stanley Kubrick�s directorial debut. I would love to be able to tell you it�s amazing, that it was a genius movie, but sadly I am unable to do that. Fear and Desire tries to be an intellectual piece that is anti-war but it is bogged down by a plot that is riddled with holes and dialogue that is rendered even more confusing by the delivery from the actors. The cinematography is one of the highlights of the piece but is still mediocre due to the editing. The music is also very loud and hasn�t been mixed properly and even detracts from the overall value of the film at some points.

Fear and Desire tells the tale of four soldiers who crash behind enemy lines as they try to survive and escape back to the safety of their own lines. However, their plans are sidetracked once they capture a young peasant girl along the way. Another soldier spots a general nearby and is determined to kill him even if it means dying himself. This movie is all about the horrors of war and it tries to portray the writer�s point of view through the movie. However, the movie never seems to be able to say what it wants to say and show what it wants to show. This is partly due to the actors being too rigid and emotionless in the delivery of their respective lines.

Frank Silvera, the actor who plays Mac portrays him in a multitude of different ways. His character is so disjointed and in every scene, the character is portrayed in a different manner, with a different tone. Virginia Leith on the other hand, actually plays her character well, even if she doesn�t say any lines. She is the only character that can be felt for and this is due to Leith�s performance.

The cinematography is relatively decent, but still doesn�t exactly do the film any wonders. Some of the shots are lit surprisingly well and actually manages to convey a slight feeling of horror. However, the music is way too loud, especially when compared to the volume of the character�s voices.

Fear and Desire is an important movie, as it establishes some of Kubrick�s themes that show up in his later work. However, if the movie is watched without the knowledge that it is a Kubrick movie, it will leave the viewer feeling confused as to the events that are occurring on screen.
