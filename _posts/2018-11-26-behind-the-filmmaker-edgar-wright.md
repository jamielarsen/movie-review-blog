Edgar Wright is a relatively new director who is well known for directing movies such as Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim and Shaun of the Dead. To this date, he has only directed five feature films. He is best known for his comedic style which involves utilising visual and auditory techniques to highlight the hilarity in the often awkward situations that he places his characters in. 

Wright made his directorial debut with A Fistful of Fingers. This was a comedic western which was made on a budget of just fifteen thousand dollars in 1993-4. The movie establishes many of Edgar Wright�s visual tropes. An example of this that is reflected in A Fistful Fingers is the scene in which a revolver is being fired at the villain. As soon as the protagonist is out of bullets, he pulls out a semi-automatic pistol. This is effective because the object that is being shown in frame obviously doesn�t fit in the context of the movie, and even though none of the characters explicitly point this out the audience automatically notices it and its presence makes the audience laugh. 

Edgar Wright�s breakthrough film was Shaun of the Dead. In this movie, he showcases his speciality of straddling multiple genres and mashing them into one movie. In my review of Shaun of the Dead, I stated that the movie played out like a romantic comedy with the added threat of zombies. While this may seem to be a horrible combination, Edgar Wright manages to make it work well. How does he manage this? Well, he keeps his movies fresh and engaging by adding heavy doses of visual comedy as well as quick cuts and transitions to keep the audience engaged.

Edgar Wright�s latest and highest grossing film is Baby Driver. In this movie, Wright exhibits his ability to use diegetic and non-diegetic sound effectively. An example of this is the opening scene of Baby Driver, in which Baby nods his head to the beat of the music and turns on the wipers. The wipers sync up to the beat and this adds a fun element to the scene, especially since the subject matter(robbery) is very serious and the music directly contrasts with the scene. Another example of Wright using non-diegetic sound effectively is in Scott Pilgrim. When Ramona dumps Scott, in the background the sound of the Trash closing on a Mac can be heard. This is an interesting idea that conveys how Scott feels to the audience, but without directly telling them how they should feel.

Wright�s next project is a documentary about Sparks. This will be his first attempt at directing a documentary. The project is currently in development and expects a 2019 release date. Edgar Wright has stated that he is currently looking through archived footage to put into the project.
