Blade Runner thrives upon moral ambiguity. We never really know which character we are rooting for. Rutger Hauer, who plays the main “villain” in Blade Runner, delivers an amazing acting performance making us question our own humanity(more on this later). Jordan Cronenweth pairs nicely with the set designers to present to the audience a visually stunning futuristic version of Los Angeles, utilising neon lighting as well as a grim, used look of society.

Blade Runner follows Deckard, a police officer who is forced by his boss to eliminate four Replicants. Replicants are human-esque robots which have been made to surpass humans in strength and match with us in terms of intelligence. However, since there is a chance that over their lifetime, these replicants may also develop emotions, the engineers who have developed these robots have also implemented a fail-safe. The robots will die after four years and will eventually be replaced. The movie’s plot is often slow but it is precisely this slow build-up that leads to an intense finale that can only be described as heart-wrenching. The ambiguity of the ending is also mind-bending.

Some of the characters can feel a little wooden at some points during Blade Runner due to their characters being robots. However, as the movie progresses and as the plot progresses the robots begin to widen up and demonstrate a larger range of emotional capabilities which allows the actors to open up as well. Rutger Hauer’s performance is amazing and provides a very emotional window into the villain's mindset especially during the “Tears in Rain” monologue.

Douglas Trumbull’s work on Blade Runner is not to be taken lightly. Many of the special effects shot are integrated into the movie so well and never feel out of place. The product placements are also incorporated into the movie in an interesting manner grounding the film. This allows the viewers to get the feeling that this version of our “future” could actually exist. However, the film defaults to using close-ups in many scenes that involve lots of dialogue. Some of these close-ups feel awkwardly framed.

I may not have fully understood Blade Runner as I might or might not have dozed off at some points of the movie. As such, I plan to rewatch it soon and if I find something else to write about I will definitely rewrite this review!
