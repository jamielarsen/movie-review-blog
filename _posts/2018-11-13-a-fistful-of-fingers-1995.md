A Fistful of Fingers is Edgar Wright’s first full feature movie and it does lack some polish. But what it lacks for in polish, it makes up for in charm and nerdery. All of the actors seem to be very self-conscious and this results in their on-screen presences seeming slightly awkward. However, this is overshadowed and made almost unnoticeable due to the comic hilarity of the script. Wright also establishes his particular brand of visual comedy in this movie.

A Fistful of Fingers is a comedy western which follows bounty hunter No-Name as he hunts down The Squint, a wanted villain who killed No-Name’s horse. A large portion of this movie seems to have been expanded and inflated for no reason at all. This led to a feeling that the movie could have been finished in 20 or so minutes. Some of the subplots lack any explanation and just pop right in the viewer’s face. While the name of the movie and of the characters may seem to be parodied of A Fistful of Dollars, this movie is a lot more creative than it seems. Edgar Wright has added some ingenious plot twists that keep the story interesting and engaging for the viewer. 

The actors in this movie have quite obviously not received any formal training. This leads to an awkward chemistry between the actors due to a slight self-consciousness in front of the camera. However, I do believe that Graham Lowe’s delivery of No-Name’s lines was comedic and well-executed. 

A Fistful of Fingers relies a lot on visual flourishes and editorial tricks to convey not only story, but also comedy. The camera is utilised to its full potential and also uses classic camera tropes from Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns. I also noticed a lot of jokes that were hidden in the background of the shot such as “Edge of Frame here”.

Although this movie was highly amateurish, it is clear to see that Edgar Wright’s potential as a filmmaker started to shine brightly in this movie. Despite a low budget and awkward performances, A Fistful of Fingers is funny and charming. Definitely worth a watch!
