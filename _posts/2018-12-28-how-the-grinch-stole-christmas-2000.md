How The Grinch Stole Christmas is not your typical Christmas movie nor is it aimed at children. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman extends the backstory of the Grinch while also presenting the Who’s as a materialistic society where everybody is more focused on themselves rather than the bigger picture. Jim Carrey’s performance of The Grinch is quirky and the makeup department have used their imaginations to create a version of the Grinch that fits Jim Carrey’s on screen portrayal of the character. 

How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a retelling of the classic story that was written by Dr Seuss. However, this iteration of the Grinch’s exploits is much more adult and spends more time expanding upon the backstory of the Grinch and his reasoning for isolating himself from society. This movie also depicts the Whos as a more materialistic with evil intentions and side agendas with the exception of Cindy Lou-Who. CIndy Lou-Who’s character is innocent and when compared to the other Whos, she is easily one of the more accessible characters in the movie.

Jim Carrey’s performance in the Grinch is once again, impeccable. Even though his character is one that most people cannot really identify with, especially since he is often quite closed off, Carrey plays the character in his usual over-the-top manner which leads to some great laughs and hilarious moments. I also appreciate the amount of effort that must have gone into the makeup and costume department as it doesn’t draw too much attention from Jim Carrey’s performance while also giving the audience the sense that the filmmaker’s have paid attention to the smallest details.

The cinematography in the Grinch is atrocious. While I get the sense that this movie is supposed to be quirky and weird, the camera angles used stand out and quickly becomes an eyesore. The camera also moves too much which is painful to the eyes. However, I did enjoy the way the set looked realistic and how the camera movements through the set never felt too limited.

**Cinematography:** 1.4/3

**Acting:** 2.1/3

**Plot:** 2/3

**Total:** 5.5/9.0 or 61.1%
