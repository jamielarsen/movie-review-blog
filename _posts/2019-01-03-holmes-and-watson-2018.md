Holmes and Watson relies on dumb and cheap humour to elicit laughs from the audience. The movie over expands certain jokes to the point of boredom. Indeed, the opening courtroom scene is a very clear example of an overexpanded scene. Will Ferrell’s performance of Holmes is not very interesting, although his delivery is perfectly timed and comedic. Both Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play off each other really well and this leads to some hilarious moments in the story.

Holmes and Watson is a very loose comedic retelling of the original Sherlock Holmes novels by Arthur Conan Doyle. The story trundles along at a slow pace even in its relatively short ninety-minute runtime. Many subplots in the movie are benched because the writers choose to highlight the long and boring comedic scenes. Another disappointing area of the films is the jokes that are used. They are often cheap and unintelligent and there is an overabundance of sex jokes used throughout the film.

Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are well known through the film industry for being a hilarious duo onscreen and this movie is no different. They play off each other to the hilarious results that are shown in the movie. However, both Ferrell and Reilly are not convincing enough when they try and sell the audience more emotional scenes(not that the writers have written them well either).

Holmes and Watson is riddled with continuity errors between cuts. The cinematography isn’t exceptional, in fact, some of the sets don’t fit into the time period and many of the shots are lit incorrectly(often too bright). Some of the shots are interesting but this shots after often showed on the screen for about a second or two. Even though I understand the editors wanting to reduce the length of this movie but the movie doesn’t leave the viewer any time to think, instead choosing to cut straight to the next comedic scene.

Holmes and Watson had an interesting premise but failed at executing what it promised to the viewer.

**Cinematography:** 1.4/3
