Tropic Thunder is a tad more intelligent than it’s comedic counterparts but still lacks an overall sense of direction. Sure the people in the movie have an aim, but their characters are just so egotistical and walled off that we(the audience) have no way of connecting with them. I do understand that this is the entire point and that this is a movie that is mocking the film industry but, in my opinion, there must always be some way of accessing the characters. However, the movie does boast an all-star cast with the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr and Jack Black. 

Tropic Thunder follows a director who tries to elicit better performances from his actors by dropping them into a “fake” warzone and setting up hidden cameras and landmines all around them. Little does he know that this fake warzone is actually real. Some members of this group include Jeff Portnoy, an actor who is addicted to drugs, Kirk Lazarus, a five-time Oscar-winning method actor who has surgically dyed his skin black to play the role of a black man, as well as Tugg Speedman, who believes that the fake warzone is fake. Tropic Thunder is highly unpredictable and the movie’s direction seems to change on a dime.

Robert Downey Jr. performance of Kirk Lazarus is absolutely hilarious but is overshadowed by Tom Cruise’s ball-bustingly funny portrayal of Grossman, a film executive. The movie also contains a whole slew of cameos from other famous stars in the film industry. However, Ben Stiller’s performance of Tugg Speedman is surprisingly mediocre given the amount of depth that the character is given(not as much as in other movies but compared to the other characters in this movie).

The cinematography in Tropic Thunder parody epic war movies as well as dramas. There is a very clear distinction drawn between scenes from “real-life” and the “movie”. The editing is also on-point, with muzzle flashes and bright lights being used to cut to the next shot. However, some of the scenes were underlit and made it hard to see.

**Cinematography:** 1.7/3

**Acting:** 2.1/3

**Plot:** 2.1/3

**Total:** 5.9/9.0 or 65%
