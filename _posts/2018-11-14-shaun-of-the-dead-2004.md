Shaun of the Dead is director Edgar Wright’s breakthrough film. Its cinematography is superbly executed and goes hand in hand with Edgar Wright’s particular aesthetic. The sound-mixing is amazing and coordinates well with the excellent editing. The acting in Shaun of the Dead is great thanks to a strong script and comedic delivery of said script. The movie plays out a lot like a romantic comedy, only with zombies.

Shaun of the Dead follows a 30-year-old guy with a dull and repetitive lifestyle, who gets dumped by his girlfriend, Liz. Suddenly, a zombie apocalypse occurs and he realises that family, friendship and love is important to him. While the movie does have its emotional moments, they never really have a huge impact on the viewer. This is mainly because some of the characters do not really get introduced in any way and as such, the viewer will not feel any sort of connection to them. I came into this movie expecting a cliched zombie comedy, but I found so much more than that. All the jokes are hilariously subtle and almost all of them rely on the camerawork and sound rather than relying on the characters telling the jokes.

The cinematography in Shaun of the Dead is, quite simply, amazing. The quick cuts blend so well with the audio while the long takes do such a good job of conveying the bland, repetitiveness of Shaun’s life. I particularly enjoyed how most of the comedy in this movie was led by the camera instead of the actors. Edgar Wright really utilises and appreciates the screen that he is being given. 

Nick Frost and Simon Pegg have a great on-screen chemistry and they really do feel like just a couple of best friends chilling out. This lends an additional layer of emotion. Simon Pegg and Kate Ashfield, however, have little-to-no on-screen chemistry and this eventually leads to their performances feeling cliched and overdone.

Shaun of the Dead is a great movie that reintroduces the romantic-comedy with a slightly zombified spin on it. The visual aesthetic of this movie is excellent and never feels old or overused. Edgar Wright is really good at using the comedic aspects of his scenes to their full potential.
