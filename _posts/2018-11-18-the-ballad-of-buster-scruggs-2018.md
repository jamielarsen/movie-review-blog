The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was meant to be a TV show told in anthological format but the Coen brothers decided to make it into a full feature film. This leads to the film feeling slightly disjointed and there is a chance that the viewer will stop paying attention during some of the stories as they are slow and meandering. However, the ending of these stories always seems to have some sort of philosophical message. This movie is also the Coen brothers first attempt at shooting a film digitally. 

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an anthological collection of six short films that take place during the settling of the west. The stories range from absurd to tragic. Sadly, a lot of the short films spend a lot of pondering and meandering and some of them feel aimless. All the movies are linked because they end with death. However, due to the stories not having anything else in common, other than the setting, the casual viewer may come away from the movie feeling confused and or bored.

The entire movie was shot digitally, a first for the Coen Brothers. Some of the scenes are lit too brightly and when combined with the other visual eye-candy that is added to the scene in post-production, parts of the movie end up being painful to the eye. However, all the shots in the movie are framed nicely and also convey the hilarity and absurdity of the situation at hand.

The order in which I would rank the stories is The Gal Who Got Rattled, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, The Mortal Remains, Near Algodones, All Gold Canyon, Meal Ticket. Although the stories are all different, they are very consistent in the structuring of the plot. All of the stories use dark humour and philosophical drama to a great extent. 

All of the actors give great individual performances, however I would like to point out the performances of just a few. Zoe Kazan played Alice Longabaugh perfectly, paying attention to the smallest details, while, James Francoâ€™s performance of the cowboy really helped highlight the irony in the situation. 

All in all, the Ballad of Buster Scruggs was an enjoyable movie that had its slow points. However, I would have preferred watching it in its original TV show format.
