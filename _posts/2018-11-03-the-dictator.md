The Dictator is funny because it doesn't care about whom the movie may offend. Sacha Baron Cohen, who is renowned for Borat and Bruno, plays his character down to the last stereotype. However, Jason Mantzoukas’s character purposes are completely ridiculous and do not make sense at all. The Dictator is cinematographed by Lawrence Sher, who is known for his work on the Hangover trilogy and Due Date. The cinematography emphasises the comedic bits in the movie and makes them a lot funnier.

The Dictator follows a dictator who goes to America to meet with the U.N, only to be kidnapped and have his beard shaved off. This somehow makes him “unrecognizable” and he is forced to break in to prevent his country of Wadiya from becoming a democracy.

This movie is eager to offend and does so. While the plot isn’t very original and contains some similarities to Coming to America, the dialogue and the delivery is what makes this movie funny. The dialogue plays on racist stereotypes and accents.

Lawrence Sher’s cinematography enhances and emphasises the comedic content in The Dictator. Some of the edits lack continuity while some cuts are quite visible. Some of the scenes feel like they go on for too long(armpit scene), while others feel too short and unsatisfactory(beard heist). 

Sacha Baron Cohen’s performance is side-splittingly funny. He leans into the stereotype and he delivers all his lines with an almost genuinely confused look. While Jason Mantzoukas’s character was funny, his goals and desires were unknown. His character behaved erratically and unpredictably. This is not the actor’s fault, but the fault of the writers. 

I enjoyed the Dictator and got quite a few laughs out of it, but it still lacked its share of emotional moments. The key to making a good comedy is being able to balance out emotional moments and comedic moments well. The actors and the cinematography were pretty good. There were some poor characterisation choices made and some scenes felt too long while others, felt too short. 

**Cinematography:** 1.9/3

**Acting:** 1.7/3

**Plot:** 1.8/3

**Total:** 5.4/9.0 or 60%
