For most breakout TV Shows, Season 4 is when they hit peak popularity. After that, they generally end up slowly getting worse and worse, until a studio executive decides to put them down. Not Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones has plenty of source material and a large budget, which is put to good use. Every episode of Season 4 is crafted beautifully. The quality of acting remains the same(amazingly good). 

I am going to copy and paste my plot review from last season and rephrase it slightly. At the centre of Game of Thrones is the Iron Throne and massive power-shifts occur throughout this entire season. No character is ever safe. In fact, one of my favourite characters died this season(in a very interesting way). I also particularly enjoy the individuality of each and every character. This is one of Game of Thrones’s major strengths. Each character is different and has strengths and weaknesses. Game of Thrones is not in any danger of stagnating like most other dramas because it leaves room for character growth.

The casting directors of Game of Thrones must be insanely talented at what they do. Every actor, even the minor ones like Kristian Nairn (who plays Hodor) and Sibel Kekilli (who plays Shae) give powerful and meaningful performances. Again, I must shine the spotlight directly at Peter Dinklage and his performance of Tyrion Lannister, which I cannot fault. Charles Dance’s performance of Tywin Lannister is that of a man who is in control and knows what to do and when to do it.

Computer-generated imagery is integrated seamlessly into on-location shots. This helps because it helps to create a sense of believability and realism on the show, which in turn helps to immerse the viewers into the single most gripping TV Show I have ever watched. Daenerys’s dragons have a sense of humanity built into their character models, something which I believe has to do with the fact that their eyes look like human eyes. I particularly enjoyed how the establishing shots that are so key to the series are so memorable and grand.

Another year, another great season...
