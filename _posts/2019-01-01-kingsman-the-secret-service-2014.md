Kingsman: The Secret Service takes the best parts of classic spy movies(great villains, well-dressed and witty protagonist) and adds a few twists of its own. The action scenes in this movie are well choreographed and as a result of the aforementioned choreography, the scenes are insanely delightful. The cinematography in Kingsman is simple but effective especially since many of the shots are uncluttered by messy backgrounds.

Kingsman: The Secret Service follows Eggsy, a British teen who seems set for a life behind bars. Suddenly, Harry Hart, a spy who works for British intelligence service Kingsman bails him out of jail and asks him to participate in a training procedure which will determine whether he will enter the Secret Service or not. Meanwhile, Valentine begins his plan to help end global warming by culling 90% of Earth’s population. One of Kingsman’s real strengths is that it keeps up its breakneck pace all throughout the movie.

Eggsy is played by Taron Egerton. Although Egerton delivers his lines in a comedic manner, he seems to lack the ability to show enough emotion to sell the character’s motivations to the audience. However, Samuel L. Jackson’s performance of the villain embodies the old Bond villains while adding his own distinctly black personality to the character. Colin Firth also plays a sort of father figure to Eggsy and it eventually comes full circle at the end of the movie.

Kingsman has a distinct visual style that is reminiscent of Tarantino movies such as Pulp Fiction. The action scenes are fast-paced and well edited. The shots are framed in a minimalistic and symmetrical manner. The action-scenes are edited in a fluid manner and I enjoyed how the mini zooms were used to simulate impact. 

Kingsman: The Secret Service draws a parallel between itself and classic spy-thrillers while also adding its own little ingredients into the mix. The story flows fast while also never pausing to look back or reflect upon the events that have occurred in the movie. Well worth a watch for any fans of any sort of spy movie!
