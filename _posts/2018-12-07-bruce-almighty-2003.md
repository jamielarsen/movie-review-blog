Bruce Almighty is inventive and is a breath of fresh air for the comedy genre. It is backed by a hilariously comedic performance by Jim Carrey and good cinematography. Bruce Almighty is a lean, mean laugh machine and never overstays it's welcome. The movie does get slightly bogged down in some of its romantic subplots. However, Jim Carrey manages to make these subplots feel light and comedic. The premise is interesting and is executed well by the director and writer of this movie, Tom Shadyac.

Bruce Almighty follows the titular character, Bruce Nolan, a self-centered news reporter who is unhappy with his life and job. After an outburst(a very long one I might add) on air, Bruce is fired from his job. He then proceeds to say a prayer. During this prayer, he angrily mocks God, saying that the Almighty isn�t very good at his job. After a long meeting with God(you heard me), God grants Bruce all his powers and subsequently goes on vacation. Bruce begins by using his powers for his own purposes and things begin to go wrong with his personal relationships and the world at large. Bruce Almighty uses comedy as a tool to advance the plot, instead of using the plot to make the viewer laugh. This makes the comedy in the movie feel legitimate and real as opposed to making the comedy feel forced to the point where it is no longer funny(as many other comedies do).

Jim Carrey plays the character of Bruce in an over the top manner. This way of playing the character works, primarily because the plot is obviously fictional as there is no way these events will ever occur in real life. Carrey�s performance is riveting specifically because of his over-the-top mannerisms. Jennifer Aniston�s performance isn�t particularly interesting, but there are moments when her performance of her character adds to the emotional aspects of the scene.

The cinematography in Bruce Almighty highlights and elaborates upon the hilarity of the absurd scenes. The camerawork reflects the scene that the character is in and the style of the shot used changes based on the scene that is being shot. A clear and noticeable example of this is the news report scenes that are captured in the style of a news report.

Bruce Almighty is a fresh and creative comedy that is funny, even 15 years after release!
