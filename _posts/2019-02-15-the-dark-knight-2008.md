Every single time I watch this movie I’ve noticed something different. There are so many intricate details hidden all throughout this amazing movie that every time you watch it, you will gain some new piece of knowledge about the characters or even the city of Gotham. I’ve watched this movie approximately fifteen times and I will keep watching it. Heath Ledger’s performance of the Joker(I know, I know, a lot of people have praised it. I’m not the first and I definitely won’t be the last) is stunning due to the way he embodies the character and makes The Joker seem so intimidating. The Joker(the primary villain of this movie) is written extremely well as a character and this provides Batman with a seemingly undefeatable villain. Although Batman does eventually defeat this villain, the carefully measured introduction of another villain towards the end adds a layer of ambiguity to the ending of the movie. The camerawork of The Dark Knight also adds a great deal of realism to the movie because Gotham feels like it's a real place that could exist somewhere on this globe.

The writers of The Dark Knight have done what is right, rather than doing what is expected of them. When writing a superhero movie, writers are expected to stick to basic genre conventions and keep the film firmly rooted in fantasy bordering on reality(for the sales of the movie). The Dark Knight decides to forget about these conventions and ground itself firmly in reality. The entire movie is just an electric scene after electric scene and it's just amazing. Themes of morality are woven into the plot seamlessly.

The entire cast of The Dark Knight’s cast is full of veteran actors, from Morgan Freeman to Christian Bale. Although all the actors give impressive performances, Heath Ledger’s performance of the Joker is scarily manic. He has paid attention to each and every detail of how his character presents himself.

The cinematography in the Dark Knight Rises is also amazing. The film is shot in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. There are many exterior wide shots in this movie that do not seem to be CGI-ed. This helps the already wonderfully realistic script, convey a deeper sense of realism to the audience.  

**Cinematography:** 2.4/3

**Acting:** 2.6/3

**Plot:** 2.5/3

**Total:** 7.5/9.0 or 83.3%
