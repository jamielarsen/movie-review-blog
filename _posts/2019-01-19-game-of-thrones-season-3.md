Game of Thrones just keeps getting better and better. This is a statement that I have been repeating and will continue to repeat throughout all my reviews of Game of Thrones. It’s not just the amazingly written plot that is charged with malice, betrayal and sometimes even humour. What makes Game of Thrones so captivating is it’s acting and it's unpredictability. The each and every member of the cast gives stunning performances as their respective characters.

At the centre of Game of Thrones is the Iron Throne and while Joffrey’s(the little-inbred bastard) position on the Iron Throne remains stable this entire season, there is plenty of drama going on throughout Westeros. One of Game of Thrones primary strengths is its ability to juggle multiple characters over multiple locations, successfully. The writers give almost equal screen time and importance to all characters, even seemingly less important ones(you just never know). The ending of Episode 9 is unpredictable and yet so important that it is bound to influence the show in every possible way.

I commented on Peter Dinklage’s performance in Season 2, stating that he and his fellow castmates seem to be getting more and more comfortable with their respective characters. This is still true. Tyrion Lannister is a character that tries to keep the mood light by utilising jokes and Dinklage’s dry sense of humour plays well and delivers quite a few hilarious moments. However, Tyrion also has his fair share of troubles and Dinklage plays to the situations that his character is placed in accordingly. 

The cinematography in Game of Thrones is also getting better and better, with the shots set in the Valyria and beyond the wall looking especially stunning due to great aesthetic and lighting choices. I also particularly enjoyed how the editing in the shots towards the end of Episode 9 built upon the unpredictability and emotional value of the Red Wedding scene.

**Cinematography:** 2.1/3

**Acting:** 2.6/3

**Plot:** 2.6/3

**Total:** 7.3/9.0 or 81.1%
