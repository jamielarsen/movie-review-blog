Sorry To Bother You begins as a comedy and ends up as an absurdist science fiction movie that targets racism, capitalism and everything in between. Sorry To Bother You also has represented telemarketing in an interesting way and the cinematography of Sorry To Bother You reflects that. The editing is pretty darn good, with certain colours and movements being used to effectively change scenes. Lakeith Stanfield’s performance of Cassius Green is hilarious while Armie Hammer’s performance of Steve Lift is charismatically believable.

Sorry to Bother You follows Cassius Green, a broke, black telemarketer who lives with his girlfriend Detroit in his uncle’s garage. Suddenly, Cassius finds his inner “White Voice” which quickly leads to him being promoted to a Power Caller, a higher position within the telemarketing company. He finds out that his company is selling slavery to large international companies, but does nothing because he does not want to jeopardise his job. Meanwhile, Cassius’s girlfriend and his former colleagues begin organising a protest against Regalview(the telemarketing company) that will enable them to unionise and get a pay rise. Sorry To Bother You aims it sharp, smart satire directly at racism by putting Cassius’s “White Voice” at the centre of everything that occurs in the movie. Sadly, the ending feels bolted on and unnecessary.

Lakeith Stanfield’s performance of Cassius Green is solid. He uses his body effectively to represent character emotions to the audience. For example, in the early parts of the movie, when Cassius is still broke, Stanfield’s character moves slower and hunches his back, signifying that his character doesn’t really care about his job, something which is reflected in the dialogue. Furthermore, when Worryfree’s true intentions are revealed to Cassius, Stanfield does a great job of illustrating his inner moral conflict to the audience. Armie Hammer’s performance of Steve Lift, the villain, is also interesting because he plays the character in such a charismatic manner that you find yourself believing in his principles.

The cinematography in Sorry To Bother You is stellar and I enjoyed how the scene transitions, were smooth and directly linked. Terel Gibson, the editor, has done a great job on that count. I also enjoyed how all the scenes were stylistically laid out.
