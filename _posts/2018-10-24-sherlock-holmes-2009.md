The core of Sherlock Holmes has always been the chemistry between Holmes and Watson. Sadly, this movie does not have that. Robert Downey Jr.(Avengers, Iron Man, Tropic Thunder) and Jude Law(Alfie, Spy, Repo Men) are both great actors, but I think that it is mainly a fault of the writers that the dynamic duo lacks a great rapport. In this adaptation, Watson is almost as smart, if not smarter at some points, as Holmes itself. This is a contributing factor to the low chemistry between the characters because, in the books, Watson is always one step behind Holmes until Holmes decides to bring him up to speed(usually quite close to the end). The hand-to-hand fight scenes perfectly capture the essence of Sherlock Holmes, with Sherlock often foreshadowing what he is going to do before he finishes the job quickly and efficiently. These scenes often use a Phantom HD which shoots at 1,000+ frames per second. When the action is slowed down and every bone break is visible, these scenes seem a lot more realistic.

Although Downey Jr. and Jude Law may lack on-screen chemistry, they more than make up for it with each of their respective solo performances. Even though they may have been limited by the poor writing, they still played the characters to the best of their capabilities.

Despite the fact that this is supposed to be an adaptation of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, there are many major differences from the book. For example, Holmes isn’t nearly as smart as he is in the books. Another example is the fact that Holmes, in the movie, doesn’t really have any flaws other than the way he seems to be unable to understand the nuances of conversation whereas, in the book, he has many flaws. These flaws make Holmes seem more real, more human.

The choice of using the Phantom HD camera was a good one and it paid off. Every punch and every blow felt like it had real force behind it. Phillipe Rousselot made a good decision when choosing to use the Phantom.

Even though there were some historical inaccuracies in the movie and some dialogue errors, Sherlock Holmes was still enjoyable and watchable. I enjoyed it despite the different creative choices made while writing this movie. I hope that part 2 widens the scope and ambition of this film while including the classic Sherlock villain, Professor Moriarty.
