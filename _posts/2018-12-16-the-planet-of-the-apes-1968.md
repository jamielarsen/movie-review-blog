Planet of the Apes is defined by its decision to not have a clear distinction between good and evil. It utilises the setting of the movie to philosophically reflect upon the condition of the human race. The movie chooses to focus on religion and cruelty, reversing the roles of humans and the apes. Every shot is beautifully framed and leaves the viewer with an off-putting sense of loneliness and emptiness.

Planet of the Apes follows astronaut George Taylor, who is sent to space where he is put in a cryogenic chamber. His ship set to return to Earth in 700 years. However, he wakes up 1300 years late and finds that his spaceship has crash-landed on an unfamiliar planet. He begins to explore the planet only to find that the roles of humans and apes have been reversed, with apes ruling the planet while humans are treated as filthy animals. The movie meditates upon the human condition, choosing to focus upon our religion and how it often contradicts science, a fact which is often ignored. There is no clear distinction between good and bad, with the main protagonist of the movie often seeming annoying and incompassionate due to the decisions that his character makes.

Charlton Heston portrayal of George Taylor is decent, however, since the sound was dubbed over(or so I am led to believe) his speech seems distant and not in tune to the tone of the scene in any way. However, Roddy McDowall, who plays Cornelius, plays the ape perfectly, using his expressions(which must have been severely hindered by the makeup) and voice to make the character seem likable while presenting him in a manner that seems relatable and human to the audience(the irony).

The cinematography in Planet of the Apes is stunning with Leon Shamroy deciding to use a large number of long shots to demonstrate the eerieness and emptiness of the planet. The last shot of the movie is so haunting that it will stay with me for many years to come. However, the editing of this movie is horrible, lacks continuity and does not do justice to the beauty of the shots.

Planet of the Apes is a captivating and entertaining science-fiction movie that I will remember for the rest of my life!

**Cinematography:** 2.5/3

**Acting:** 2.1/3

**Plot:** 2.3/3
