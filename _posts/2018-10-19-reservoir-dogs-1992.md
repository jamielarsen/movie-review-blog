Reservoir Dogs is sharp and smart, much like Quentin Tarantino himself. This movie has brilliant camerawork that lets the actors shine in a way that cannot be shown through quick cuts during the dialogue. Even though the movie may have been on completed on a low budget, it never shows it, thanks to great acting and an even better screenplay. 

Reservoir Dogs is a movie about a heist that goes wrong because they were ratted out to the cops. However, the heist is never shown, and instead, the film focuses on the Dogs trying to figure out who the rat was. 

The dialogue and even the action is written in a fast-paced manner. The script thrives on having situations where the plot isn’t being advanced by any dialogue. However, during these situations, we do learn something about the characters. My main example here is the opening scene. Nobody cares at all about Madonna, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick. But what is important is that in this scene you start to feel connected to the characters. You start to feel attached to them. This is similar to the technique used in It(2017) where you feel connected to the kids because they talk and act like real kids, not robots with sticks up their asses.

This movie was recorded on a shoestring budget(just 1.2 million dollars), but it isn’t very noticeable to the audience. Most of the movie was shot in a warehouse because that is where it is set. Another example is in the infamous torture scene where a cop’s ear is removed, during which the camera pans away. This is very intelligent, as not only does it leave the audience to imagine what is happening, it also minimizes the amount of post-production visual effects “patching up” that needs to be done. 

The cinematography is effective and is done in long takes, so as to make the viewer feel more immersed. However, the only downside of this is that the viewer may start to disengage due to the short attention spans of audiences. 

All the actors give performances just short of amazing. However, Steve Buscemi(Con Air, Fargo) is great as Mr Pink and Harvey Keitel(Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver) gives a performance that tugs on the audience’s heartstrings(slightly).

All in all, Reservoir Dogs was a fun movie to watch and I enjoyed it. Even though it was one of Tarantino’s lowest budgeted efforts it still contained polish and classic Tarantino-isms.
