Brooklyn Nine-Nine has such a diverse cast of well-rounded characters that all come from different walks of life and that is one of the main reasons for this series’ comedic potential. The characters have all been crafted to have interesting relationships with each other and play off each other so well. The camerawork emphasises both funny moments and emotional moments. The series is comedic but also packs some emotional gut-punches(that episode about sexuality and Hispanic parents).

Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a single-camera situation comedy which follows the detectives of the 99th Precinct in Brooklyn across all their hijinks.

Andy Samberg(Hotel Transylvania trilogy, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping ) is at the core of this show’s success and he delivers the lines energetically. Without him, Jake Peralta wouldn’t be the same. While he may be the shell of this show the other actors also deserve credit for how they don’t all play the characters with the same fast-paced delivery. Chelsea Peretti plays her character as a diva, where the character could have been played very differently in the first season thereby changing the course of the characters arcs.

A lot of the character arcs were brought to a close satisfyingly enough this season. However, the Shamus Murphy arc ended in an underwhelming way. I am relieved that the writers found a way to breathe fresh life into the recurring Halloween episodes. The episodes with the Pontiac Bandit are always creative and interesting every season.

The characters are all different and they all feel like real humans that we could possibly meet someday. This a refreshing change of pace from other sitcoms such as Full House and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air which all force their characters to conform to stereotypes such as the cool one(Uncle Jesse from Full House) or the smart one(Carlton from Bel-Air). 

There are some subtle things like camera zooms to emphasise comedic moments that the casual viewer may not notice but it works well.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine may not be the best show ever but I still don’t understand why FOX would even think about letting it go. My heartfelt thanks to NBC for picking it up and allowing the show’s creators to continue expressing their creativity.
