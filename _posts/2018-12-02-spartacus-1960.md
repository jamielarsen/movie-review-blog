Spartacus is definitely a classic. Kirk Douglas�s performance of the titular Spartacus when combined with the amazing character development and lucid cinematography makes this movie well worth its three-hour runtime. Although this movie was not written by Stanley Kubrick(it was written by Dalton Trumbo and based on a book by Howard Fast), it still contains certain story themes that seem to reflect Kubrick�s other work such as Paths of Glory.

Spartacus tells the story of a Thracian slave who is sold to be a gladiator. After being trained to kill, Spartacus turns on his owner and begins a slave revolution. The slave army moves from town to town, looting, plundering as well as freeing other slaves who join their army. The Roman Senate begins to get worried. Spartacus tries to lead his army towards a dock, where he tries to transport his entire army out of Italy, only to be betrayed and to have to turn back and face the Roman empire head on. One of the greatest parts of Spartacus is watching the characters grow and develop over time. All the characters story arcs conclude in a satisfactory way. Even though the ending of the movie may not be the expected ending, it is a good one and ends the movie on a melancholy note.

The cinematography is absolutely amazing. This is especially reflected in the massive battles. None of the people in the movie are computer-generated. Instead, Kubrick hired extras to participate in the movie. Some of the backgrounds look painted, but this lends the movie an extra sense of class. Some of the edits are confusing because they do not give the audience any understanding of chronological timeline and as such we do not know the order in which events are occurring.

Kirk Douglas embodies the character of Spartacus and his performance of the character changes in accordance with the events that the character goes through. An example of this is after Spartacus gets married to Varinnia, he plays the character much more joyfully and Spartacus has more of happy nature for a while.

Spartacus is an experience that builds as the movie goes on. Although some people may not be patient enough to wait through its three-hour long runtime, the people who do will find an engaging historical drama.
