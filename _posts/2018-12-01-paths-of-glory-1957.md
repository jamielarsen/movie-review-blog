Paths of Glory is a compelling movie that is part anti-war drama and part courtroom drama. It has such an emotional punchline that is accentuated by an amazing performance from Kirk Douglas. Kubrick uses cinematography effectively to hit the correct notes on the emotional register. However, the ending of the movie feels like the ending of a different movie entirely. Despite this, it still feels satisfactory.

Paths of Glory follows Colonel Dax after he is asked to complete an unachievable task by his commanding officer. This commanding officer optimistically estimates that 55% of the soldiers will die during the battle as if the soldiers were chess pieces. However, during the battle, one of the battalions is unable to move because they are pinned down by heavy enemy fire. When the commanding officer sees this, he orders his own men to fire on the battalion on account of cowardice. The men refuse to fire without a written order. Commanding Officer is angered by this and forces each of the battalion commanders to pick a soldier to be put to the death. However, Colonel Dax steps up to try and save them. The characters may be stoic but they still have enough depth to make the final outcome feel saddening and depressing. The ending of the movie may not fit well, but it is still masterfully crafted and bittersweet.

Kirk Douglas’s performance of Colonel Dax really makes the audience root for his character and the actors who play the men who are put on trial are so good at conveying their emotions. George Macready also portrays General Paul Mireau so well, especially at the beginning of the movie when the viewer has no idea who the main character is. Macready plays him in the manner of the smart, strong general, so that we are even affected even more when the general starts revealing his true colours.

Georg Krause, the cinematographer for Paths of Glory, has made some amazing choices in the framing and composition of the shots. This movie is shot entirely in black and white and this adds depth and realism to the characters, making the audience connect to them. The war scenes in Paths of Glory have been captured extremely well and really capture the futility of war.

The meaning of the movie’s ending may vary from person to person, however, I believe that is exactly why this movie is so good. It leaves almost everything up to the imagination, but it still manages to convey one recurring theme. Violence is never the answer.

**Cinematography:** 2.2/3

**Acting:** 2.1/3

**Plot:** 2.4/3
