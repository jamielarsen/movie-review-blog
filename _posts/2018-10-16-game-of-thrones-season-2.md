*This review will be free from spoilers of Season 2 but will contain some spoilers of Season 1.*

Game of Thrones is renowned for the deviousness of some its characters and this season is no different. As I stated in my previous review of Season 1, GoT relies on its source material for its plot. However, the writers have not only taken the characters from the book, but improved them, while the actors add a layer of depth to them that is hard to communicate through the written word. The overall quality of the CGI and visual tone of the series has improved this season. The fact that the actors are getting more comfortable with their characters as the series progresses is also quite clear.

As I stated before, Game of Thrones’s backbone is its story. Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off. Joffrey is still a massive dick and Tyrion is as devious as ever. All the characters want to win and keep the Iron Throne. This season goes deeper into the reasoning behind why the characters want the Iron Throne as well as introducing some new players to the Game of Thrones. There are no clear distinctions between good and bad thanks to some excellent writing(except in Joffrey’s case).

The actors are starting to get used to their characters. Emilia Clarke(Terminator Genisys, Me Before You) and Peter Dinklage(Infinity War, Pixels) steal the show yet again with Clarke giving an amazing performance as the desperate Khaleesi. Dinklage’s performance as Tyrion is both funny and serious. He understands that Tyrion has no other choice than to accept his stunted height because he recognizes that it is mainly due to his affliction that he is smart.

This season’s production value is much higher. As such, the quality of the special effects is much better than before as is the camerawork in this season which is also of a much higher calibre.

In closing, the second season of Game of Thrones is an excellent piece of television. There is a lot more bloodshed in this season thanks to Joffrey(what a dickhead). There are some minor issues that don’t really impact the show too meaningfully. Everything that happens, happens for a reason. So try and remember everything...
