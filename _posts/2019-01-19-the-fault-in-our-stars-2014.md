The Fault In Our Stars is a buildup towards a masterfully executed, emotionally charged ending. In fact, the ending is so satisfying, due to the quality of acting that we are exposed to throughout the course of the story. However, despite the proclamation at the start of the movie stating that “this movie is not like other romance movies” and The Fault In Our Stars then endeavours to include almost every possible romantic cliche into the movie(except for the ending of course). However, because Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley add their own little quirks to their respective characters.

The Fault In Our Stars follows Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenage cancer patient who meets Augustus Waters at a cancer support group. They begin to fall in love and Hazel gives Augustus one of her favourite book's, which he ends up loving. Suddenly, Augustus decides to take Hazel on a trip to Amsterdam where this reclusive author is living. The Fault In Our Stars is just so predictable and this is one of its major faults. This movie does, however, take a realist view on life and I applaud it for sticking to an ending that reflects that. I also believe that most of the narration used in the movie is completely useless. Furthermore, there are many jumps in time from scene to scene that it can be hard to keep track of the movie’s timeline. 

Ansel Elgort’s performance of Augustus Waters is perfect. Waters is written as a cocky character, however, Elgort has taken this cocky character and made him humorous and sharp rather than cocky. He has also added this element of endless optimism to the character. This is effective because the moment we see the character lose his optimism, we break down too.

The lighting in The Fault In Our Stars is vibrant. This is meant to reflect the endless optimism and perseverance that the characters demonstrate. This changes towards the end of the movie when it slowly begins to get harder for the characters to be optimistic. Music is used effectively but the inclusion of an original score would have helped the emotional moments hit much harder.
