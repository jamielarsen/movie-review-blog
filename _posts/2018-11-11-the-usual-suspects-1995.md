The Usual Suspects is slow and uninteresting, almost up until the end, but as soon as the viewer is hit with the final plot twist of the movie, everything else is blown out of the water. The movie isn’t very gripping on the first watch, but once you do know what the ending of the movie is, the viewer will notice the tiniest details in not only the plot but the performances as well as the way the camera manages to obscure the face of the true villain. Kevin Spacey performance of Verbal Kint is amazingly good. The cinematography in The Usual Suspects is not particularly good, but manages to draw attention to Keyser Soze(the villain).

The Usual Suspects follow Verbal Kint, a cripple, as he attempts to convince the cops that neither he nor his crew is responsible for messing up a heist which caused a boat to explode. The story is told in a subjective manner, with the entirety of it being told from Verbal’s point of view. I particularly enjoyed how the story was told to the viewers. The movie is told in past-tense as Verbal recounts the events of the night during the heist.

While I was watching The Usual Suspects, I felt like I was missing out on crucial plot details. However, it was only once I got to the ending that I realised that I had picked up on exactly what the movie wanted me to. While the main part of the movie isn’t very engaging, the ending more than makes up for it. Although the plot of the movie doesn’t feel very original from a retrospective lens, it would have been considered highly original and creative in the 90s, when this film was released. I also believe that this movie would have laid out the core foundations of all heist and crime movies over the coming decades. 

Kevin Spacey gives an amazing performance as Verbal Kint. He focuses on all the details, right down to Verbal’s limp(which seems useless, but is actually quite interestingly detailed). The cinematography in The Usual Suspects manages to draw the viewer’s attention to Keyser Soze, but somehow still manages to obscure our view of the infamous kingpin’s face. One of the scenes had a heavily stylised aesthetic which I really enjoyed.

The Usual Suspects is a great movie that is heavily hampered by it's “setup phase”(which lasts for most of the movie). However, the plot twist is so mind-blowingly unexpected that it makes you go back and review what happened previously.
