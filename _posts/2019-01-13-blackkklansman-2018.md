BlacKkKlansman targets racism by using its emotionally-charged story to elicit strong responses from the audience. It’s not afraid to go through dark and occasionally racy territory to draw these reactions. By doing this, the movie feels all the more realistic, rather than feeling like a fictional event that is set hundreds of years ago. Although I was expecting the movie to end in a more uplifting manner, BlacKkKlansman ends with a sombre, grim scene that I suspect was added in light of recent events,

BlacKkKlansman begins with the announcement that “dis joint is based on some fo’ real, fo’ real shit” which basically means “this movie is based on a true story”. Set in the 70s, it follows the first black cop in the Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron Stallworth. Undeterred, he sets out to make a name for himself by infiltrating the KKK. BlacKkKlansman is anything but subtle and uses derogatory expletives liberally to make it's point clear.

I don’t really agree with the casting choice of Topher Grace for David Duke. This is due to the fact that Grace isn’t nearly charismatic enough to play David Duke. Duke’s lines are written for a man who commands all the attention in the room, while Topher Grace looks like a weedy kid who has put on a fake moustache. Nonetheless, BlacKkKlansman does boast some impressive performances. An example of this is Adam Driver’s performance of Flip, a Jewish police officer who is asked to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. He is forced to say racial slurs pertaining to Jewish culture. Even though he does so, Driver shows the audience how much this affects the character through the delivery of his lines.

The editing in BlacKkKlansman is mediocre. Barry Alexander Brown fails to cut and his edits lack continuity. Furthermore, there are many scene transitions that are unpleasant on the eye and leave the viewer to guess where this scene fits into the whole scheme of the movie. This is a major issue because we never get the sense of scale that this investigation had. The KKK is a major organisation and I am sure that at least 50% of the viewers would like to know the time frame during which this investigation took place. Was it a year? Was it a month?
